# Project Introduction: Capstone Project Module 3 - California Housing Dataset

## Overview
This repository showcases my Capstone Project for Module 3, which involves an end-to-end analysis and deployment of a machine learning model using the California Housing dataset. The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for housing prices based on various features that describe housing characteristics and the surrounding environment. The project follows a comprehensive data science pipeline, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment.

## Problem Statement
The goal of the project is to accurately predict median house prices in California based on key features such as location, population, and housing characteristics. Such predictions can assist stakeholders, including real estate agencies and policymakers, in making data-driven decisions.

## Project Steps
1. **Understanding the Problem and Data**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and potential issues in the dataset.

2. **Data Preparation and Feature Engineering**
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Create derived features such as `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, and `population_per_household` for additional insights.

3. **Modeling and Evaluation**
   - Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
   - Select and tune the best-performing model to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

## Key Outcomes
- A highly accurate LightGBM model tailored for predicting housing prices.
- Feature engineering insights that enhanced model performance.
- Successful deployment to GCP with a user-friendly prediction interface.
